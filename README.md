![Logo](website/public/VScouterLogo.png)

## Introduction

VScouter is a versatile scouting application designed for FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) teams. It simplifies the data collection process for scouting teams during competitions, providing a robust and efficient platform to gather, analyze, and store performance metrics of competing robots.

## Features

- Data collection though a [website](https://vscouter.netlify.app/)
- Website can be ran offline in environments with no internet
- Auto completion for teams to scout on scouting website
- Visual and intuitive buttons and pictures to help scout real-time
- USB flash drive data collection process

## Usage

### Using The Website

1. Visit [https://vscouter.netlify.app/](https://vscouter.netlify.app/)
2. **Main Page:** When the scouter loads into the app there are 4 main buttons. The `Full Screen` button makes the website go into full screen mode. The `Dump Data` button will download a JSON file of the scouting data. See [Collecting Data](#collecting-data) for more info. The `Start Scouting` button continues to the game start scouting page.
   ![HomeScreen](/readmeimages/HomeScreen.png)
3. **Settings Page:** Has various buttons for debugging and for loading auto match suggestions. `Get Match Data` redirects to the page for getting the auto match suggestions. See [Auto Completion Match Data](#auto-completion-match-data) for more info. `Clear Match Data` clears the auto match suggestions. `Clear Scouting Data` clears the scouting data that is saved on the device. `View Scouting Data` opens a page where the user is able to see the JSON version of the scouting data for debugging. The `Parse Data` button brings the user to the parse data page. See [Parsing Data](#parsing-data) for more info.

5. **Game Start:** The `Select Alliance` component allows the scouter to select the alliance they are scouting. The `Match Number` component allows the scouter to enter the match they are scouting. The `Scouting Initials` component allows the scouter to enter their initials. The `Select Team` component shows auto completion buttons that are based on the alliance and match that the scouter inputted previously. Additionally, the scouter may choose to select a different team than auto suggested. The button/input that is darker than the other is what is selected. The scouter may choose to click the `Back` Button to return to the past page. To advance to the next page, the scouter can click the `Proceed` button.

7. **Auto Scoring:** The page is separated into two main sections: coral and algae. In the coral section there is a side view of the reef separated into the levels of it: L1, L2, L3, L4, and Drop/Missed. Then there is a set of all the places you can pick a coral up in auto: the station, mark 1, mark 2, and mark 3. The roadmap of the user's input is selected where they got a coral and then where they placed it. In the algae section, the user may select where they picked up an algae (the reef, mark 1, mark 2, and mark 3) and where they placed it (net shot, processor, and drop/miss). The `Passed Starting Line` button automatically selects if the scouter selects any other action. The `Proceed` button starts blinking after 15 seconds to remind the scouter to switch pages.

8. **Teleop Scoring:** This page is similar to the auto scoring page. The page is separated into two main sections: coral and algae. In the coral section there is a side view of the reef separated into the levels of it: L1, L2, L3, L4, and Drop/Missed. Then there is a set of all the places you can pick a coral up in auto: the station and the carpet. The roadmap of the user's input is selected where they got a coral and then where they placed it. In the algae section, the user may select where they picked up an algae (the reef and carpet) and where they placed it (net shot, processor, and drop/miss).
   | Keybind | Button                |

9. **Endgame Scoring:** The `Shallow Climb`, `Deep Climb`, and `Park` buttons represent what the robot can do on the barge. Then there are toggles for if the robots climb failed, it played defense, and it if it broke down. The `Comments` textbox allows for the scouter to write any additional information such as if they broke down or got penalties.

### Analysis

Analysis is done through Power BI. You can download it for free [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/downloads).

1. To analyze the CSV data you downloaded at [Parsing Data](#parsing-data) you must download the [Power BI file in this repository](/analysis/VScouterAnalysis.pbix). Once downloaded, put the `pbix` file into a folder with nothing in it.
2. Next put you CSV file into the same folder as the `pbix` file. Rename it to `VScouterFullData.csv`
3. Open the `pbix` file with Power BI. To use this new data click `Transform Data` and then `dataFolderPath`. On this page change the directory to where the `pbix` file and CSV file are located (ex. `C:\Users\username\Documents\Analysis`). **There should not be a `\` at the end.**
3. Click `Close & Apply`.

### Auto Completion Match Data

#### **Generating**

1. `cd parsing`
2. `python3 GetMatchData.py`
3. Enter your event key (like 2024njdd)
4. Enter your [TBA API](https://www.thebluealliance.com/apidocs) key

This code is used to generate the auto completion data for the scouting app. Once this data is generated it is downloaded into the [data folder](/data/EventMatches.json). To use this on the scouting apps, you must host this online on a GitHub repository. Now that it is hosted online, to make the QR code you can visit a [common QR code generator](https://getsiimple.com/tools/qr-code-generator/). **You need to make the QR code based on the raw data (shown below).**
![RawGitHubData](readmeimages/RawGitHubData.png)

#### **Using**

To use generated match suggestions:

1. Click the `Settings` button on the home screen.
2. Click `Get Match Data`.
3. Allow use of device camera.
4. Show and scan the generated QR code.
5. Click `Done`.
